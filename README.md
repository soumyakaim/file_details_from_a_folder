# SK-first-project
Trying my hand at making python projects for my portfolio and keep track of my progress.

Project 1: Python automation script.

Project 2: IOT based project.

Project 3: Full Stack Application.

Project 4: Game development (plus if involves physics simulation).

Project 5: Scraping project.

Project 6: Also my own domain for emails rather than @gmail.com. seems cool and more commanding. 

Project 7: Actually, I want a code/project to use raw fNIRS and EEG files to understand what they mean and how i can use them to analyse the files further. Aimed at students, researchers and just curious people who want to learn how to preprocess fNIRS and EEG data.
