> My first project is to write a python script that will give me details of conetnts of a folder including their filename, file type, date created, size and the same information about it's sub folders. 
Outout will be in CSV for each folder. 

> Good to say that the mission has been accomplished. 
The python file is online and so is it's example output excel file. 

I did this to manage my files and have their detials on hand without maually checkign all the folders/subfolders.
